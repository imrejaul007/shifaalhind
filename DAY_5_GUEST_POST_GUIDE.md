## Real Patient Story

**Ahmed M., 52, Dubai**

*"I needed triple bypass surgery. My Dubai cardiologist quoted AED 150,000. Through Shifa AlHind, I went to Apollo Hospital Mumbai for AED 30,000 - saving AED 120,000.*

*The care was exceptional. My surgeon had performed over 8,000 bypass surgeries. The hospital was more modern than I expected. The coordinator spoke Arabic, which made my wife comfortable.*

*Surgery went perfectly. I stayed 7 days in hospital, then 2 weeks in their guest house for recovery. Total trip: 3 weeks.*

*I'm back in Dubai now, working full-time, feeling great. Best decision I ever made."*

**Savings:** AED 120,000 (80%)
**Outcome:** Excellent
**Would recommend:** Absolutely
