   - Select your "shifaalhind" service

2. **Open Shell:**
   - Click "Shell" tab (top navigation)
   - A terminal will open connected to your production server

3. **Run Seed Command:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```

4. **Expected Output:**
   ```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Admin Pages Show Empty Lists**

**Cause:** Production database not seeded
**Solution:** Run `npm run db:seed` in Render Shell

### **Issue: Login Not Working**

**Cause:** Admin user not created
**Solution:** Run `npm run db:seed` to create admin user

### **Issue: Dropdown Selectors Empty (Doctors, Packages, Articles)**

**Cause:** Related entities not created
**Solution:** Seed database with sample data

### **Issue: Delete Validation Not Working**

**Cause:** Expected behavior - validation prevents deletion when referenced
**Solution:** First delete dependent entities, then parent

### **Issue: Images Not Uploading**

**Cause:** Cloudinary not configured
**Solution:** Follow `CLOUDINARY_SETUP_GUIDE.md` and add env vars

### **Issue: 500 Error on Admin Pages**

**Cause:** Database connection issue or auth error
**Solution:** Check Render logs for details:
```bash
# In Render Dashboard
View Logs → Recent logs
```
