## Introduction

For UAE residents - both Emiratis and expats - seeking medical treatment, the costs in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and other emirates can be prohibitively expensive, especially for complex procedures. A single cardiac surgery can cost AED 150,000-300,000 ($40,000-$80,000), while orthopedic procedures, fertility treatments, and specialized care carry similarly high price tags.

Just a short 3-hour flight away, India offers the same quality medical care at 60-80% lower costs, with no waiting lists, personalized attention, and world-class hospitals that treat over 500,000 international patients annually.

This comprehensive guide covers everything UAE patients need to know about medical tourism to India - from cost comparisons and hospital selection to visa processes, flight options, and cultural considerations.

### How to Maximize Insurance Reimbursement

**Before Travel:**
1. Call insurance company
2. Get pre-authorization if possible
3. Ask about documentation requirements
4. Clarify coverage limits

**During Treatment:**
