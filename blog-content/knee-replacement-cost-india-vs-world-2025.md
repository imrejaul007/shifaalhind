## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long do knee replacements last?
Modern knee implants last 15-25+ years in most patients. About 90-95% last at least 15 years. Factors affecting longevity include patient weight, activity level, implant quality, and surgical technique.

### Can I fly after knee replacement surgery?
Yes, after medical clearance (typically 10-14 days post-surgery). Short-haul flights (Dubai to India, 3-4 hours) are safe. You'll receive compression stockings and blood thinners to prevent clots.

### Will I set off metal detectors at airports?
Sometimes. Knee implants may trigger metal detectors. We provide an "implant card" stating you have a prosthetic knee, which helps at security checkpoints.

### How painful is the surgery?
Modern pain management makes knee replacement much more comfortable than before. You'll have spinal anesthesia during surgery and multimodal pain control afterward (nerve blocks, epidural, oral medications). Most patients rate pain as 3-5/10 with medications.

### Can both knees be done at once?
Yes, bilateral knee replacement can be done in one surgery if you're healthy and fit. Benefits: One recovery period, less total cost, faster return to normal life. Requires good heart/lung health and is best for younger patients (under 70).

### When can I walk after surgery?
Same day or next day! You'll stand and take a few steps within 24 hours. By day 3, you'll walk with a walker. By discharge (day 4-5), you'll use crutches or a walker independently.

### How long until I can drive?
Usually 4-6 weeks if it's your right knee, 2-3 weeks if left knee (automatic transmission). You need good knee control and quick reaction time. Your surgeon will clear you based on your progress.

### Will I need physiotherapy after returning home?
Yes, physiotherapy is crucial for best results. Continue 3x/week for 6-8 weeks minimum. We provide detailed home exercise program and can arrange physiotherapy referrals in your home country.

### What if something goes wrong after I return home?
Your Indian surgeon remains available via video consultation. We coordinate with your local orthopedic doctor. Serious complications requiring return to India are extremely rare (less than 0.5%).

### Is India safe for medical tourism?
Yes, especially in major cities and hospital areas. Hospitals have 24/7 security, hotels are safe, and medical tourism is a major industry. We arrange all transport and stay in safe areas. Millions of international patients visit India annually.
