## Introduction

For couples from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and other GCC countries struggling with infertility, the dream of having a child can come with a hefty price tag. IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) and other fertility treatments in the GCC region often cost $12,000 to $20,000 per cycle, with no guarantee of success on the first attempt.

India has emerged as a global leader in fertility treatment, offering world-class IVF services at 50-70% lower costs than GCC countries, with success rates matching or exceeding international standards. Each year, over 15,000 international couples choose India for fertility treatment, and the numbers continue to grow.

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about pursuing IVF and fertility treatment in India as a GCC patient in 2025.
