## üí° Key Insights from Planning

**1. Batching is Critical:**
Creating 24 pages individually would take 12+ weeks. Batching similar content reduces time to 10 weeks.

**2. Templates Save 50% Time:**
With templates, each article takes 2.5-3.5 hours instead of 5-6 hours.

**3. Priority Matters:**
Starting with high-volume keywords (cancer, dental, diabetes) delivers ROI faster.

**4. Quality Over Quantity:**
Better to have 10 excellent 2,500-word articles than 20 mediocre 1,000-word articles.

**5. Compound Effects:**
Each new article strengthens the entire site. Internal linking creates a powerful network effect.

**6. Patience Pays:**
Month 1 results are modest, but Month 6-12 results are exponential as Google recognizes authority.
