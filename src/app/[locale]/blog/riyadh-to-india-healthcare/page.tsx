Success rates for major procedures are comparable or better than Saudi hospitals. Over 30,000 Saudi patients travel to India annually for medical treatment. India treats 500,000+ international patients per year from 150+ countries."

            q: "2. How much can I save compared to Riyadh?",
            a: "70-85% on average. Even after including flights (SAR 2,200), accommodation (SAR 2,500-7,000), and visa (SAR 280), you save SAR 40,000-256,000 depending on the procedure. Heart surgery saves ~SAR 142,500, knee replacement saves ~SAR 51,250, liver transplant saves ~SAR 256,250."

          {
            q: "3. What about the medical visa process for Saudis?",
            a: "Very simple for Saudi residents. Apply online (3-5 days approval) or get visa on arrival (some airports). We send you a medical visa invitation letter from the hospital. Cost: SAR 280. Medical visa is valid for 60 days and allows 3 entries. Family members can accompany on medical attendant visa. No need to visit Indian Embassy."
          },
          {
            q: "4. Do hospitals understand Saudi culture and Islamic values?",
            a: "Yes, hospitals are very accommodating. All major hospitals have prayer rooms with Qibla direction, serve 100% halal food, provide Arabic-speaking staff who understand Saudi dialect, respect Ramadan and prayer times, and can arrange female doctors for women patients. Many hospitals have treated thousands of Saudi patients and understand cultural sensitivities."
          },
          {
            q: "5. Can I use my Saudi government/private insurance?",
            a: "Some insurance plans cover international treatment. Check with your insurance provider (Bupa, Tawuniya, Medgulf, etc.) about coverage for treatment abroad. Some hospitals like Fortis and Apollo have tie-ups with Saudi insurers and can do cashless/direct billing. If not covered, you pay upfront and claim reimbursement upon return to Riyadh with hospital invoices and discharge summary."
          },
          {
            q: "6. How long do I need to stay in India?",
            a: "Depends on the procedure: Simple procedures (dental, cataract, endoscopy): 3-5 days. Moderate procedures (knee replacement, hernia, gallbladder): 10-14 days. Complex procedures (heart surgery, transplants): 3-4 weeks. We provide estimated timelines during FREE video consultation. Most patients return to Riyadh within 2 weeks."
